% Displaying Data

For the application designer, the layout and organization of data for display on
the TV means dealing with a unique set of issues, different from those one would
face when designing for mobile devices or the desktop.

The TV is often the focal point of a room in which it is surrounded by the rest
of the user's living experience--a couch, table, chairs, bed, dresser, sound
system, lights, fireplace, etc.  Applications that are cluttered with excessive
content, decision points, and complicated UI can prevent users from having the
comfortable and personal experience they seek.

Simply put, when the area devoted to data and content is too dense, it destroys
the app experience.  While determining the optimal amount of data in an app
always involves some level of subjectivity, we have found through user studies
that, generally, less is better.  Less data is easier to read, navigate, and
make quick decisions about, and is less likely to overwhelm the user.

Metadata or possible actions one may perform on an object do not need to be
displayed each time that object appears.  For example, items in a list should be
shown with a bare minimum of metadata, along with a single action.  By contrast,
on a detail page, it is appropriate to present all the metadata and all the
possible actions related to an object.  Knowing when to show data and when not
to is a key factor in preserving the simplicity of the Lean Back experience.

The following patterns include solutions for loading and organizing data:

* [Detail Pages](displaying-data/detail-pages.html)
* Lists and Grids
* Loading

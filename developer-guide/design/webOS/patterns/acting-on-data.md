% Acting on Data

The patterns for Acting on Data provide solutions for performing actions on
lists of data, individual data objects, and object metadata.  You may enable
these actions in the Action Bar of any panel within your app.

The Action Bar provides a consistent location for actions performed in the
context of the current panel or current state of the panel.  Common actions
include: Filter, Sort, Search, Edit, Move, Delete, Switch View, Share To, Add
To, Favorite, Download, Buy, Rent, etc.

While, in general, actions should be placed in the Action Bar whenever possible,
there are times when it makes more sense to present actions either inline or on
top of fullscreen content.

If Inline Actions are needed, they should appear close to the focused object.
When presenting a list of objects, choose familiar icons or standard text
buttons that are only displayed when the actionable object receives focus.  When
you need to place actions near an object that is both not in a list and not the
primary object in the panel, use a contextual popup.

When displaying fullscreen content, actions (e.g., Share To, Add To, Record,
Favorite, Queue, Slideshow) should be included with the playback controls.
Fullscreen Content Actions may open popups with additional sets of actions if
needed (e.g., "Share to Facebook" controls or recording options). 

webOS Moonstone icons for common actions will soon be available for download.

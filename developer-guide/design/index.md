% Design Guide

We are pleased to offer the following resources to those designing apps using
the Enyo framework and Moonstone UI library:

* [Design Principles](principles.html) - Guidelines for designing TV apps

* [UI Patterns](patterns.html) - A discussion of TV UI patterns

* [UI Theming](ui-theming.html) - How to override library styles

* [Styles](styles.html) - This section name sucks. It's about fonts, colors and other design considerations

## enyo/kind

[enyo/kind]($api/#/module/enyo/kind) is the Enyo framework's module for
generating kinds.  A kind is a constructor-with-prototype (like a class) that
has advanced features like prototype-chaining (inheritance).

A plug-in system is included for extending the abilities of the kind generator,
and constructors are allowed to perform custom operations when subclassed.

In this article, we look at several things that happen when `kind()` is invoked.
To learn about what happens once you have an instantiated object, see [Objects
and Published Properties](objects-and-published-properties.html) and
[Components](components.html).

## Special Property Names

Generally, the properties defined in the configuration object passed to `kind()`
are copied directly to the	generated prototype, but certain property names
trigger special processing.	Some examples of special properties are:

* `name`: Defines the name of the created constructor in the global namespace
    (intermediate objects are created automatically).  `name` is not copied
    directly to the prototype, but is instead stored as `kindName`.

    ```javascript
        var
            kind = require('enyo/kind');

        // Create a function myNamespace.MyKind with a prototype.
        // myNamespace.MyKind.prototype.kindName is set to 'myNamespace.MyKind'.
        // myNamespace.MyKind.prototype.plainProperty is set to 'foo'.
        module.exports = kind({
            name: 'myNamespace.MyKind',
            plainProperty: 'foo'
        });
        // Make an instance of the new kind.
        var myk = new myNamespace.MyKind();
    ```

* `kind`: The name of, or a reference to, a kind to derive from, like a
    superclass.  The new constructor's prototype is chained to the prototype
    specified by `kind`, and the `base` property in the new prototype is set to
    reference the `kind` constructor.

    ```javascript
        var
            kind = require('enyo/kind'),
            Object = require('enyo/Object');

        // Create a function MyKind with a prototype, derived from enyo/Object.
        // MyKind.prototype.kindName is set to 'MyKind'.
        // MyKind.prototype.base is set to 'enyo/Object'.
        module.exports = kind({
            name: 'MyKind',
            kind: Object
        });
    ```

* `constructor`: An optional function to call when a new instance is created; it
    is actually stored on the prototype as `_constructor`.

    ```javascript
        // Create a function MyKind with a prototype, derived from enyo/Object.
        // _constructor_ is called when an instance is created.
        var
            kind = require('enyo/kind'),
            Object = require('enyo/Object');

        module.exports = kind({
            name: 'MyKind',
            kind: Object,
            constructor: function() {
                this.instanceArray = [];
                // Call the constructor inherited from Object
                this.inherited(arguments);
            }
        });
    ```

* `statics`: Properties from any `statics` object are copied onto the
    constructor directly, instead of the prototype.

    ```javascript
        // Create a kind with a static method.
        var
            kind = require('enyo/kind');

        module.exports = kind({
            name: 'MyKind',
            statics: {
                info: function() {
                    return 'MyKind is a kind with statics.';
                }
            }
        });
        // Invoke the static info() method of MyKind.
        console.log(MyKind.info());
    ```

* `protectedStatics`: Introduced in Enyo 2.3, protected statics are statics that
    are meant for use only within the kind in which they are declared, or in
    code that derives from that kind.

    Unlike public statics, protected statics won't prevent the deferral of a
    kind's creation.  Deferral is not possible for kinds containing public
    statics because of the potential for the public statics' being used before
    any instances of the kind exist.

Certain kinds in the framework define their own special properties, e.g., the
`published` property supported by [enyo/CoreObject/Object]($api/#/kind/enyo/CoreObject/Object).

## Lifecycle of a Trivial Kind

A trivial kind has a simple lifecycle:

```javascript
    var
        kind = require('enyo/kind');

    module.exports = kind({
        name: 'MyKind',
        kind: null, // otherwise it will default to 'Control'
        constructor: function() {
            // do any initialization tasks
        }
    });
```

That's it.  `MyKind()` is now a function that you can use with the `new`
operator to create instances.

```javascript
        myInstance = new MyKind();
```

Like all JavaScript objects, a kind instance will be garbage-collected when
there are no references to it. 

## Inheritance: this.inherited()

It's common for one kind to be based on another kind.  The new kind inherits all
the properties and methods of the old kind.  If the new kind overrides a method
from the old kind, you can call the overridden method using `this.inherited()`:

```javascript
    var
        kind = require('enyo/kind');

    module.exports = kind({
        name: 'MyNextKind',
        kind: MyKind,
        constructor: function() {
            // do any initialization tasks before MyKind initializes
            //
            // do inherited initialization (optional, but usually a good idea)
            this.inherited(arguments);
            //
            // do any initialization tasks after MyKind initializes
            }
        });
```

`MyNextKind` starts with all the properties and methods of `MyKind`, but then we
override `constructor()`.  Our new constructor may call the old constructor
using the `this.inherited()` syntax.  The first parameter passed to
`this.inherited()` must be the literal `arguments`, which is a special
JavaScript variable containing information about the executing function.  (For
more about `arguments`, see
[developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments).)

In its constructor, `MyNextKind` may specify things to do before or after
calling the old constructor, or it may choose to not call the old constructor at
all.

This override system works the same for any method, not just `constructor()`:

```javascript
    var
        kind = require('enyo/kind');

    module.exports = kind({
        name: 'MyOriginalKind',
        doWork: function() {
            this.work++;
        }
    });

    module.exports = kind({
        name: 'MyDerivedKind',
        kind: MyOriginalKind,
        doWork: function() {
            if (this.shouldDoWork) {
                this.inherited(arguments);
            }
        }
    });
```

Note that you could also call an inherited method using only raw JavaScript,
like so:

```javascript
    MyKind.prototype.<method name>.apply(this, arguments);
```

However, the `this.inherited()` syntax is shorter and eliminates the need to
specify the superkind's name (in this case, `MyKind`).

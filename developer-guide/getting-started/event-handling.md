% Event Handling

Enyo employs a message-passing strategy for indirect communication between
components.  We refer to these messages as "events" to dovetail with common DOM
usage.  In general, events bubble up the component tree from child to parent.
When using the `dom` package (part of the Enyo core), DOM events and custom
events are unified.

The use of events is key to enforcing encapsulation in your component design.
In most cases, the child of a component should have no knowledge of its parent.
Instead of calling functions on (and thus tightly binding itself to) its parent,
a child should send events, which the parent may choose to handle or not handle.

While sending events from child to parent is the standard paradigm in Enyo, in
some situations the implementation of this model can result in inefficient and
unwieldy code.  Thus an alternative method of communication exists--this
involves the use of [enyo/Signals]($api/#/kind/enyo/Signals/Signals) and is
discussed at the end of the current document.

## Sending Events

A component declares the events that it sends using an `events` block, e.g.:

```javascript
    events: {
        onStateChanged: ''
    }
```

Note that, by convention, event names always start with `'on'`.

For each event registered in a component's `events` block, a helper function
`do<EventName>(event)` is created on the kind, which the component may call to
send the event up the component tree.  This function takes an optional `event`
parameter, which must be an object and can contain event-specific information
to be passed to the handler.  For example, to send the `onStateChanged` event
from the example above, a component would call:

```javascript
    this.doStateChanged(newState)  // parameter is specific to the 'onStateChanged' event
```

Under the hood, the `do<EventName>` function wraps Enyo's generic `bubble`
function for sending events up the component tree:

```javascript
    this.bubble(eventName <, event, sender>)
```

* `eventName` is the event name (including the `'on'` prefix).

* `event` is an object containing event-specific information (this is
    the same object listeners receive as `event`, although it may be decorated,
    e.g., with the `originator` property).  Note that this must be a JavaScript
    object, not a primitive.

* `sender` should almost always be omitted, although you could use it to force
    a particular sender for the next handler.

**Note:** Declaring an `events` block and using the `do<EventName>` helper
function is preferable to calling `bubble()` directly, since the `events` block
is more descriptive and serves to define the interface to your kind.

## Creating Handlers

An event handler is a function assigned to "catch" events bubbling up from
children.  For example:

```javascript
    myEventHandler: function(sender, event) {
        // Can return true to indicate that this event was handled and
        // propagation should stop
    }
```

* `sender` is the immediate sender of the event--that is, the last
    [enyo/Component]($api/#/kind/enyo/Component/Component) to touch the event
    before passing it to `this`.

* `event` is an object that contains event data.  For DOM events, this is the
    standard DOM event object.  For custom events, it's a custom object.

The handler may return a *truthy* value to stop propagating the event.  Otherwise,
it will continue bubbling up the component tree. 

Note that the meaning of the return value is different from the classic DOM
convention (historically, the return value would determine whether the default
action occurs).  If you need to control the default action on a DOM event, use
the modern equivalent, `event.preventDefault()`.

`event.stopPropagation()` will not prevent propagation of events in Enyo;
instead, return `true` from the handler.

Because events propagate until stopped, an event's sender (`sender`) may be
different from its originator (i.e., the component that originally fired the
event).  The originating component is available to the event handler as
`event.originator`.

For example, when clicked, a button originates an `onclick` event, which
bubbles up the control chain.  The button's parent may bubble the event up to
the button's grandparent.  From the grandparent's perspective, the originator is
the button and the sender is the button's parent.

## Attaching Handlers to Events

There are two common ways of handling events in a component.  The first is to
set a handler name on an object owned by the component, like so:

```javascript
    components: [
        {name: 'thing', ontap: 'thingTap'}
    ],
    thingTap: function(sender, event) {
        // do stuff
    }
```

The second is to name a catch-all handler in the `handlers` block, like so:

```javascript
    handlers: {
        ontap: 'anythingTap'
    },
    anythingTap: function(sender, event) {
        // do stuff
    }
```

Note that if you use both event handling strategies at the same time, you
will receive the event in both places by default.  You may avoid this behavior
by preventing propagation in `thingTap()`.  For example:

```javascript
    components: [
        {name: 'thing', ontap: 'thingTap'}
    ],
    handlers: {
        ontap: 'anythingTap'
    },
    thingTap: function(sender, event) {
        // taps on _thing_ will bubble up to _anythingTap()_ also,
        // unless I stop propagation here
        return true; // handled here, don't propagate
    }
    anythingTap: function(sender, event) {
        // do stuff
    }
```

If you need more sophisticated handling, you can use the `sender` and
`event.originator` properties to help you discern the provenance of the event.

## DOM Events

In Enyo, DOM events are allowed to bubble all the way up to `document`, where
they are handled by `enyo/dispatcher`.  The dispatcher figures out where to send
the event and provides hooks for various bits of event processing.

Whenever possible, the dispatcher avoids disturbing original DOM events.  To
forcibly stop the bubbling of a DOM event, you may return `true` from the
event's handler method.

In addition to the `target` property, which is set on all event objects, Enyo
specifies a `dispatchTarget` property, which is set to the Enyo control
containing the event target.

The following DOM events are handled by Enyo:

* mousedown
* mouseup
* mouseover
* mouseout
* mousemove
* mousewheel
* click
* dblclick
* change
* keydown
* keyup
* keypress
* input
* paste
* copy
* cut
* resize
* load
* unload
* message
* hashchange
* webkitTransitionEnd
* transitionend
* webkitAnimationEnd
* animationEnd

If there are additional DOM events that you want Enyo to handle, use the
`listen()` method on `enyo/dispatcher`.  For example, the following code sets up a
handler for an event called `myEvent`:

```javascript
    var
        dispatcher = require('enyo/dispatcher');

    dispatcher.listen(document, 'myEvent', handleMyEvent);
```

Here the first parameter is an event receiver to listen on (typically `document`
or `window`).  The second parameter is the name of the event to listen for, and
the third is the handler method. 

In addition to DOM events, there are a number of normalized input events that
the dispatcher sends as synthesized "DOM-like" events (e.g., `ontap`, `ondown`,
`onup`, `ondragstart`, `ondrag`, `ondragfinish`, `onenter`, and `onleave`).
Most of these events work across platforms, so client code does not have to
distinguish between touch and mouse interfaces.  These events are discussed in
detail in the following section.

As a matter of convention, DOM events and DOM-like events remain lowercase when
dispatched as Enyo events (i.e. `ontap`), but custom events declared by Enyo
kinds use camel case (i.e., `onStateChanged`).

## Normalized User Input

As noted above, Enyo supports a set of normalized, DOM-like events that work
similarly across all supported platforms.  These events are provided so that
users can write a single set of event handlers for applications that run on both
mobile and desktop platforms.  They are needed because desktop and mobile
platforms handle basic input differently.  For example, desktop platforms
provide mouse events, while mobile platforms support touch events and a limited
set of mouse events for backward compatibility.

### Normalized Input Events

Event normalization takes place in the `enyo/gesture` module in Enyo core.

The following normalized events are synthesized from the available
DOM events:

* `down` is generated when the pointer is pressed down.

* `up` is generated when the pointer is released up.

* `tap` is generated when the pointer is pressed down and released up.  The
	target is the lowest DOM element that received both the related `down` and
	`up` events.

* `move` is generated when the pointer moves.

* `enter` is generated when the pointer enters a DOM node.

* `leave` is generated when the pointer leaves a DOM node.

* `dragstart` and `dragfinish` are sent for pointer moves that exceed a certain
    threshold.

* `drag` and `drop` are sent to the original target of the pointer move, to
    provide information about the item being moved over (or released over)
    another element.

* `dragover` and `dragout` are sent in addition to `over` and `out` while
    there is an active drag.

* `hold` is generated when the pointer is held down without moving for a short
    period of time (~200ms).

* `release` is generated when the pointer is released after being held down, or
    is moved off of the node while still held down, but before any potential
    `dragstart` event.  The target is the same as that of the `hold` event.

* `holdpulse` is generated when the pointer is held down without moving for a
    short period of time; it repeats periodically about once every 200ms.  Use
    this event to trigger an action after a given period of time.  The elapsed
    time is available in the `holdTime` property.

* `flick` is generated when the user flicks the pointer quickly.  This event
    provides flick velocity data through the properties `xVelocity` (velocity
    with respect to the horizontal axis) and `yVelocity` (velocity with respect
    to the vertical axis).

(Note that, on the Android platform, the `touchmove` event must be prevented
via `event.preventDefault()`, or the Enyo dragging system will not function
correctly.)

Bear in mind that normalized input events are generated on Enyo controls, not
DOM elements.

These normalized events are handled in the usual Enyo fashion, as outlined
above.

### Normalized Input Event Properties

Normalized input events have the following common properties, when available:

* `target`
* `relatedTarget`
* `clientX`
* `clientY`
* `pageX`
* `pageY`
* `screenX`
* `screenY`
* `altKey`
* `ctrlKey`
* `metaKey`
* `shiftKey`
* `detail`
* `identifier`

## Keyboard Input

Because Enyo apps may be run on the desktop, the framework must also be able to
deal with hardware keyboard input--which, unlike mouse input, cannot be
translated into normalized input events. 

Now, in most cases, you won't have to worry about setting up your application
code to accept keyboard input directly.  If your app uses the [text field
kinds](../building-apps/controls/text-fields.html) built into Enyo and
Moonstone, those kinds will handle keyboard input automatically.  However, there
may be situations--in some games, for instance--in which you want your app to
respond directly to keyboard-related DOM events.

To do this, you can use an `enyo/Signals` instance to listen for the events
`onkeydown`, `onkeypress`, and `onkeyup`.  Each keystroke fires an `onkeydown`
and an `onkeyup`; if the keystroke generates a character, there will also be an
`onkeypress` event fired between `onkeydown` and `onkeyup`.

We'll look at how this actually works in code, but first, a proper introduction
to Signals is in order.

## Signals

There may be times when two distantly-related components in your app need to
communicate with each other.  Using the standard event model, you would pass an
event up to a common parent (in the worst case, the top-level app kind) and then
pass the event back down to the target component.  Because this may require a
significant amount of plumbing, Enyo provides an alternative.

[enyo/Signals]($api/#/kind/enyo/Signals/Signals) provides a means of
broadcasting and subscribing to global messages, bypassing the normal component
tree.  Within the Enyo framework itself, DOM events that have no node targets
are broadcast as signals.  These events include window events, like `onload` and
`onbeforeunload`, and events that occur directly on `document`, like
`onkeypress` if `document` has the focus.  (We'll see an example of this in the
following section, [Handling Keyboard Input with
Signals](#handling-keyboard-input-with-signals).)  Signals are also useful for
hooking up non-Enyo events (e.g., Cordova/PhoneGap events) to be handled by Enyo
kinds in application code.

To broadcast a message, a sender simply invokes the static `send()` function on
`enyo/Signals`:

```javascript
    var
        Signals = require('enyo/Signals');

    Signals.send(eventName, event);
```

* `eventName` is the event name (including the `'on'` prefix).

* `event` is an optional object containing event-specific information.

To listen for a signal, a component should include a Signals instance in its
`components` block.  It should also specify a handler for the signal by setting
the `<messageName>` property of the Signals object to the name of a method in
the owning kind.  This method is then called whenever a `<messageName>` signal
is received.

For example, the following kind...

```javascript
    var
        kind = require('enyo/kind'),
        Signals = require('enyo/Signals');

    module.exports = kind({
        name: 'Receiver',
        components: [
            // 'onTransmission' is the message name and 'transmission' is the
            // name of a handler method in my owner.
            {kind: Signals, onTransmission: 'transmission'}
        ],
        transmission: function(sender, event) {
            // respond to the signal
        }
    });
```

...will handle signal events dispatched by a call like this:

```javascript
        Signals.send('onTransmission');
```

Note that, like all Enyo message handlers, the signal handler (`transmission()`)
receives two parameters: a reference to the component that sent the message (in
this case, our own Signals object, `this.$.signals`), and any event payload
that the transmitter included in the broadcast.

Some important things to note:

* The signal name passed into `send()` must exactly match the message name in
    the receiving Signals instance; both must include the `'on'` prefix.

* All Signals instances that register a handler for a particular message name
    will receive the message.

* The `send()` method is on `enyo/Signals` itself, not an instance of a Signals
    component.

* Do not abuse Signals.  Coupling objects with global communication is considered
    evil.

## Handling Keyboard Input with Signals

Now, returning to the subject of keyboard input, the following example kind uses
Signals to implement some simple handling of keyboard events:

```javascript
    var
        kind = require('enyo/kind'),
        FittableRows = require('layout/FittableRows'),
        Signals = require('enyo/Signals');

    module.exports = kind({
        name: 'KeyboardEventExample',
        kind: FittableRows,
        classes: 'onyx',
        components: [
            {name: 'myContent', content: 'Please do not press the spacebar.'},
            {kind: Signals, onkeypress: 'handleKeyPress',
                onkeydown: 'handleKeyDown', onkeyup: 'handleKeyUp'}
        ],
        handleKeyDown: function(sender, event) {
            // Can use event.keyCode to detect non-character keys
            if (event.keyCode === 8) {
                // respond to backspace
            }
        },
        handleKeyPress: function(sender, event) {
            // Use event.charCode to detect spacebar
            if (event.charCode === 32) {
                this.$.myContent.set('content', 'I thought I asked you not to press the spacebar.');
            } else {
                var key = String.fromCharCode(event.charCode).toUpperCase();
                this.$.myContent.set('content', 'Last key pressed: ' + key);
            }
        },
        handleKeyUp: function(sender, event) {
            // Respond to keyup, if desired
        }
    });
```

Within the `onkeydown` and `onkeyup` handler methods (`handleKeyDown()` and
`handleKeyUp()`), `event.keyCode` is the JavaScript key code representing the
key that was pressed.  In the `onkeypress` handler (`handleKeyPress()`),
`event.charCode` is the decimal value of the Unicode character generated by
the keypress; you can get the character itself as a string by passing
`event.charCode` into `String.fromCharCode()`.

For example, let's say I press the `J` key on my keyboard to type a lowercase
"j".  First, an `onkeydown` event is fired, in which `event.keyCode` has a
value of `74`, the JavaScript key code for "j".  (Note that there is no
distinction between lowercase and uppercase in the JavaScript key codes.) Then
an `onkeypress` event is fired, in which `event.charCode` has a value of 
`106`, which is the decimal value of the Unicode character lowercase "j".
Finally, an `onkeyup` event is fired, in which, once again, `event.keyCode` is
`74`.

Now, let's say I press `"SHIFT + J"` on my keyboard to type an uppercase "J".
This fires two sets of `onkeydown`/`onkeyup` events.  In the first,
`event.keyCode` has a value of `16`, representing the SHIFT key, and there is
no associated `onkeypress` event since there is no character generated.  In the
second `onkeydown` and `onkeyup`, `event.keyCode` has a value of `74`, which
we've seen is the JavaScript key code for "j".  Between the second `onkeydown`
and the second `onkeyup`, an `onkeypress` event fires, in which the value of
`event.charCode` is also `74`, representing the decimal value of the Unicode
character uppercase "J".

Note that returning true from the `onkeydown` handler will prevent the `onkeyup`
from firing, but will not suppress the `onkeypress` event.

% Enyo Apps on Windows 8

In this article, we present instructions for developers wishing to deploy Enyo
applications to PCs and tablets running Windows 8, via the Windows Store.

## Before You Begin

In order to build and test your Enyo application for Windows 8, you will first
need the following:

* [Enyo 2.2 or later](../getting-started/bootplate.html)
* A PC running Windows 8 (and, optionally, a tablet running Windows 8)
* Visual Studio 2012 (Professional, Premium, or Ultimate edition) or
    [Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows 8](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-for-windows-8)

## Building and Testing

### 1. Create Your Enyo Application

Build your Enyo application using the Bootplate template, as described
[here](../getting-started/bootplate.html).

### 2. Create a New Visual Studio Project

* Open Visual Studio and select **File > New Project**.

* Your project structure will be built with your main page named `default.html`.
    Change the name of this file to `index.html` to match your Enyo application.
    In the **Solution Explorer** on the right-hand side of the screen,
    double-click the `package.appxmanifest` file to open it.  You will see a
    field labeled **Start Page**.  Update this field value to match your
    `index.html` starting page.

* Your project will include `css` and `js` folders by default.  Feel free to
    delete these from the project.

* Copy your Enyo bootplate app into your Visual Studio project structure.  Make
    sure that your application files are included in the project by
    right-clicking on your files and folders and selecting the **Include in
    Project** contextual menu item.

* Replace your project's `index.html` file with the `index.html` from your
    Bootplate app, or else edit it to look like the following:

    ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"/>
            <meta charset="utf-8" />
            <title>Enyo 2 Sampler</title>

            <!-- css -->
            <link href="build/enyo.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
            <link href="build/app.css" rel="stylesheet"/>

            <!-- js -->
            <script src="build/enyo.js"></script>
            <script src="build/app.js"></script>
        </head>
        <body class="enyo-unselectable">
            <script>
                new App().renderInto(document.body);
            </script>
        </body>
        </html>
    ```

### 3. Build and Deploy Your Project Locally

In Visual Studio, select **Debug > Start Debugging** to build and debug your
project on your local PC.

### 4. Build and Deploy Your Project on a Remote Device (Surface)

First, install Remote Tools for Visual Studio 2012 on your Microsoft Surface.

* On the Surface, open Internet Explorer and navigate to
    <http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-additional-software>.

* Select the item **Remote Tools for Visual Studio 2012**.

*  Download and install the **Remote Tools for Visual Studio 2012 (ARM) â€“ English**.

Then, launch and configure the debugger that you just installed.

* On your Surface, open the Remote Debugger application.  (Note that it will
    open in the PC environment.)

* Select **Tools > Options**.

* Select **No Authentication** and ensure that **Allow any user to debug** is
    checked.  (You may need to set authentication based on your network
    situation.)

* Make sure that your computer and your Surface are on the same network. In
    Visual Studio, select **Remote Machine** as your debug/build target.

    Once **Remote Machine** is selected, you should be able to locate your
    Surface on the network.

## Enyo Sampler on Windows 8

It's also possible to install the Enyo Sampler app on your Windows 8 PC or
tablet.  To do so, you'll need to download the built app (in an archive called
`ProjectOutputFolder.zip`), either from the
[Enyo Bug Tracker](https://enyojs.atlassian.net/browse/ENYO-1899) or from the
[Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) file sharing service.

To obtain the file from Dropbox, connect to Dropbox (via browser or client app)
using the following credentials:

```
    username: enyojs@hotmail.com
    password: olympus
```

The zip file is in the `Win8Sampler` folder.

Once you have the file, unzip it and open the resulting folder
(`ProjectOutputFolder`) in Explorer.  Then do the following:

* Navigate to the folder called `ProjectOutputFolder\AppPackages\EnyoSampler_0.0.1.0_AnyCPU_Debug_Test`.

* Right-click the `Add-AppDevPackage.ps1` file and select **Run with PowerShell**.

    If the PowerShell window flashes and disappears:

    - Press **Start** and type `PowerShell`.
    - Right-click the PowerShell shortcut and select **Run as Administrator**.
    - In the new PowerShell window, type `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`.
    - Answer **Y** at the security prompt.
    - Go back to the Explorer window and try running the `Add-AppDevPackage.ps1`
        script again.

    (For more information on installing app packages in Windows 8, see
    <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh975356.aspx>.)

* If you are prompted to acquire a Developer License, answer **Y** and use these credentials:

    ```
        user: enyojs@hotmail.com
        pass: olympus
    ```

* If you are prompted to install a local certificate, answer **Y**.

* The installation script should proceed until it says `"Successfully installed"`.

* Press **Start**, swipe all the way to the right and find the Enyo Sampler app;
    tap or click it to launch.
